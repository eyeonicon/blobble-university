# Blobble Caretaking Revenue Share

Blobble is a unique blockchain-based game that allows users to take care of their own Blobbles by supplying them with Love, Food, and Drink. In addition to providing a simple and adorable gaming experience, Blobble also offers users the opportunity to earn BST rewards through its caretaking revenue share.

Here's how the caretaking revenue share works:

- Users can supply their Blobbles with Love, Food, and Drink. These daily caretaking actions are free and generate transactions on the ICON blockchain.
- Users can also pay ahead and keep their Blobble healthy for up to 7 days.
- 100% of the caretaking fees that are generated get used to mint BST. A 5% tax fee is applied here.
- Afterwards, the minted BST gets added to the Blobble treasury.
- Each day, 20% of the Blobble treasury is paid out to the owners of healthy Blobbles.

Blobble Caretaking Revenue Share provides one of many ways for users to earn BST rewards by taking care of their Blobbles. By simply supplying their Blobbles with Love, Food, and Drink, users keep their Blobble healthy and become eligible to receive BST. A healthy Blobble is a happy Blobble.

There are multiple ways to obtain BST, including:

- Minting BST with bnUSD at the Blobble Finance tab on Blobble.xyz.
- Owning a healthy Blobble unlocks BST rewards distribution, which provides a passive income stream in BST for users.
- Voting for the Eye on ICON Validator Node makes users eligible for BST rewards distribution.
