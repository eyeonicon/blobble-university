# Blobble Sales Revenue Share

Blobble is a unique blockchain-based game that allows users to take care of their own Blobbles by supplying them with Love, Food, and Drink. In addition to providing a simple and adorable gaming experience, Blobble also offers users the opportunity to earn BST rewards through its sales revenue share.

Here's how the program works:

- When a new baby Blobble is minted, 70% of the sales price gets used to mint BST. A 5% tax fee is applied here.
- The BST that is minted gets added to the Blobble Treasury.
- Afterwards, the minted BST gets added to the Blobble treasury.
- Each day, 20% of the Blobble treasury is paid out to the owners of healthy Blobbles.

Blobble Sales Revenue Share provides one of many ways for users to earn BST rewards by simply participating in Blobble sales. When a new baby Blobble is minted, a portion of the sales price gets used to mint BST, which is then added to the Blobble Treasury. And by holding onto healthy Blobbles, users can earn a share of the daily payouts from the Blobble Treasury.

There are multiple ways to obtain BST, including:

- Minting BST with bnUSD at the Blobble Finance tab on Blobble.xyz.
- Owning a healthy Blobble unlocks BST rewards distribution, which provides a passive income stream in BST for users.
- Voting for the Eye on ICON Validator Node makes users eligible for BST rewards distribution.
