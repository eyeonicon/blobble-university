# Blobble's UpOnly Transaction Taxing

In the world of cryptocurrency, one of the key features of a successful token is its ability to maintain a strong and stable price. In order to achieve this, some tokens have implemented mechanisms such as transaction taxing. BST, the native token of Blobble, is no exception.

When minting or redeeming BST, users are subject to a 5% transaction fee. This fee is designed to ensure that the price of BST continues to rise incrementally over time, a concept known as UpOnly. 

But there are other factors at play as well. For example, Eye on ICON validator node rewards are wired through the BST contract, providing additional value to BST holders. In addition, 70% of Blobble sales revenue is wired through the BST contract. 

Another way that the BST contract keeps getting put to work is through the addition of 100% of all Blobble feeds (food, drink, and love) to the BST contract.

Overall, these mechanisms work together to create a fun and valuable token that rewards holders for their participation in the Blobble ecosystem. So the next time you mint or redeem BST, keep in mind that the transaction fee is helping to increase the token's value and appeal!
