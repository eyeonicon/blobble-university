# Backed by bnUSD: Understanding the Unique Mechanism of BST

BST is a blockchain token that is backed by ICONs native bnUSD. But unlike traditional stablecoins, BST's price is designed to subtly trend upwards over time, providing an opportunity for users to benefit from both price appreciation and bnUSD's stability.

The mechanism behind BST's price increase is based on a unique minting and burning system. Users can mint BST by locking up bnUSD, and can redeem bnUSD by burning BST. 

Each time a user performs a mint or a redeem transaction, a 5% tax fee is applied. This fee is then redirected towards the rest of the locked bnUSD, causing the amount of locked bnUSD to grow at a faster rate than the total minted BST supply. 

As a result, the per token price of BST trends upward, incentivizing users to hold onto their tokens as they could potentially increase in value over time.

There are multiple ways to obtain BST, including:

- Minting BST with bnUSD at the Blobble Finance tab on Blobble.xyz.
- Owning a healthy Blobble unlocks BST rewards distribution, which provides a passive income stream in BST for users.
- Voting for the Eye on ICON Validator Node makes users eligible for BST rewards distribution, providing another way to obtain BST.
